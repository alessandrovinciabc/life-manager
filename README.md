## Life Manager
Web app to manage todos with multiple projects/lists support. Everything gets stored in localStorage for data persistence. Uses webpack to bundle different javascript modules together.

### Goals
- Experimenting with organizing my code into multiple files
- Trying out custom events to handle logic on the controller instead of normal ones
- Starting from the backend and building from there to see how it works
